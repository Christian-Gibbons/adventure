<h2>Adventure gone wrong</h2>
<ul>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Was intended to be a mouse-controlled adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Go on an adventure
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Adventure
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Left mouse-click does... something
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I wanted to implement an effective and elegant-looking path-finding algorithm to work with the mouse controls.  My initial thought was to implement the A* path finding algorithm with a slight modification to cut corners when there is no obstacle in the way of the next node, however when passing my idea by my humanoid robotics professor, he recommended I look into potential fields.  After looking into it, potential fields seemed like an interesting concept that can give an organic feel to the path-finding and it works on-the-fly to adapt to moving obstacles.  Implementation was... less than successful.  The character only wants to move in one direction regardless of where the mouse is clicked, though mouse proximity to the character does make a difference, and the collision tiles do provide a repelling force.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A wildly bouncy character with difficult to understand movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a person with apparently limited motor control.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
